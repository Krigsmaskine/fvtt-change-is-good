## What?:
Change is Good is a module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, only made possible through the TyphonJS Runtime Library (TRL) and the unending patience of the inhabitants of the Foundry Discord server. A module for the DnD5e system that tracks changes to documents (actor, token) and reacts to it. 

## Features, specifically, please.
*CiGSyncProfActor2NPC* - as the name might suggest, allows you to synchronize an actor's proficiency bonus to an NPC's. Requested out of the wazoo for Spiritual Weapons, badgers and warlocks' familiars alike. Note: DnD5e calculates proficiency bonus, so this works by changing the CR of the NPC to the actor's level, which should give the same proficiency bonus. 

### How?

## That's it? What else?
Of course, I have grand plans, but honestly, my skills aren't there yet. I'm working on them, but I'm a developer led by selfish ambition. Feel free to lodge an issue with a request and I can see how feasible they are to add. I'll add a list of things I'm working on personally... when I get around to it.
